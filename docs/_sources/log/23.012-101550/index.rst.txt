It is known by many names.

- Divine Proportion
- Golden Ratio, Mean, Section
- Extreme and Mean Ratio

Many references will begin telling you it is a number equal to 

.. math:: 1.618...

But this is incomplete and meaningless.

To understand the true meaning of the Divine Proportion, we first must understand the principle of a geometric mean. A geometric mean is a relationship of three values :math:`a, b, c` where

.. math::
   \large
   \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{c}

so a simple example would be

.. math::
   \large
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}

But what if we were to define :math:`c = a + b` so our geometric mean is expressed with only two values

.. math::
   \large
   \frac{a}{b} = \frac{b}{a+b}

We can begin to find a solution for this by multiplying :math:`a` and :math:`b` by a common value :math:`\lambda`

.. math::
   \large
   a * \lambda &= 1\\
   \large
   b * \lambda &= \phi

This allows us to translate our geometric mean to an expression with one variable, :math:`\color{#C90}{\phi}`

.. math::
   \large
   \frac{1}{\color{#C90}{\phi}} = \frac{\color{#C90}{\phi}}{1+\color{#C90}{\phi}}

if we do a little algebraic manipulation, we see that our mean can be expressed as a quadratic expression.

.. math::
   \color{#C90}{\phi} * \frac{1}{\color{#C90}{\phi}} &= \color{#C90}{\phi} * \frac{\color{#C90}{\phi}}{1+\color{#C90}{\phi}} \\
   1 &=  \frac{\color{#C90}{\phi}^2}{1 + \color{#C90}{\phi}} \\
   ( 1 + \color{#C90}{\phi} ) * 1 &=  ( 1 + \color{#C90}{\phi} ) * \frac{\color{#C90}{\phi} ^ 2}{1 + \color{#C90}{\phi}} \\
   1 + \color{#C90}{\phi}  &=   \color{#C90}{\phi} ^ 2 \\
   0 &= \color{#C90}{\phi}^2 - \color{#C90}{\phi} - 1

.. math::
   \large
   ax^2 + bx + c =  0 

.. math::
   \large
   \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}

.. math::
   \large
   a = 1, \, b = -1, \, c = -1

.. math::

   \large
   \mathbf{\Phi^2 \, - \, \Phi \, - \, 1= \, 0 }\\


.. math::
   \large
   \mathbf{roots\; of\; \phi \, :=  \,  \left\{  \left(\frac{-\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, 0 \right),  \left(\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, 0 \right) \right\} }

.. math::
   \large
   \mathbf{\color{#C90}{\phi} \, =  \, \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}  } \approx 1.618033989\\
   \large
   \mathbf{\color{#C90}{\varphi} \, =  \, \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} } \approx .618033989\\

.. math::
   \large
   .5 \times 5^.5 + .5



A proportion is a relationship between two values. Such as  1:2 or a:b or a/b

**Two values are in The Divine Proportion when the ratio of the lesser value over the greater value is equal to the greater value over the sum of the lesser and greater value.**

In other words, when a segment is sectioned into the Divine Proportion, the parts are in a harmonic relationship to the whole.

The very nature of the Golden Ratio is harmonic resonance
